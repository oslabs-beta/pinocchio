<h3 align="center"> Pinocchio is an Electron powered GUI for Puppeteer test generation with Mocha and Chai. This user friendly application allows users to identify selectors for their tests and preview their code in the provided code editor. Once the tests have been created, an exportation of the test suites into the user's application is only a button click away.
